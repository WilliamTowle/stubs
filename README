STUBS
=====


Overview
--------

* What it is

  The STUBS Toolchain and Utility Build Suite is a set of scripts
driven by pre-written configuration files, which builds one or more
software packages in sequence. STUBS is designed to work in very
minimal environments -including those without 'make'- and URLs are
included to permit downloading source and patches beforehand. Among
configuration files and scripts provided are the facilities to create
boot media for Franki/Earlgrey Linux (one of several example
busybox- and uClibc-based Linux environments) and the intention is
that STUBS can enable such a system to rebuild itself.

* What it Isn't

  STUBS is not a replacement for 'make'; it assumes the dependencies
any packages have will have been satisfied in advance, i.e. the
absense of software not yet built will abort the build, rather than
automatically prompting the necessary builds. Individual build steps
can be managed by Makefiles or shell scripts, which alleviates some
instances where this is a problem.
